A simple iPhone app to make your iPhone camera see the world full of anonymous people.

Making use of [OpenCV Library](http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/) to do face detection and AVFoundation to capture camera inputs.

Created with the help of Yoshimasa Niwa san's great [XCode project sample](https://github.com/niw/iphone_opencv_test) and [blog post](http://niw.at/articles/2009/03/14/using-opencv-on-iphone/en).
